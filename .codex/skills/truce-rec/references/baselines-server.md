# Baselines And Server Workflow

Use this reference for official baselines, same-candidate artifacts, server
handoffs, and import/evaluation gates.

## Main Baseline Contract

Main LLM baseline comparisons should use:

```text
official project implementation where claimed
  + Qwen3-8B base model
  + LoRA adaptation
  + official/default or reported-optimal hyperparameters
  + same TRUCE splits and fixed candidate rows
  + same TRUCE evaluator
  + source_event_id/user_id/item_id/score preservation
```

Ours may tune only through the declared validation protocol. Baselines must not
be tuned on TRUCE test outcomes.

Do not silently mix full fine-tuning, QLoRA-only runs, original project
checkpoints, different backbones, or different adapter budgets into the main
Qwen3-8B-LoRA table. If such runs are useful, separate and label them as a
reference or appendix protocol.

## Baseline Families

Main official LLM4Rec families:

- TALLRec
- OpenP5
- DEALRec
- LC-Rec
- LLaRA
- LLM-ESR

TRUCE-side Qwen3-LoRA adapter pilots are useful diagnostics, but they are not
official-native baselines unless an official-fidelity audit promotes them.

## Same-Candidate Data Lane

Target four-domain protocol:

- `beauty_supplementary_smallerN_100neg`
- `books_large10000_100neg`
- `electronics_large10000_100neg`
- `movies_large10000_100neg`

Do not resample users, negatives, histories, or candidates inside TRUCE. Do not
edit producer-side `candidate_items.csv` or `ranking_valid/test.jsonl`.

Cross-project score exports must use:

```text
source_event_id,user_id,item_id,score
```

Local adapter imports may use `example_id,user_id,item_id,score` only where the
existing TRUCE importer expects it.

## Server Operating Model

Server `pony-rec-gpu` is now directly accessible via SSH (key-based auth):

```bash
ssh pony-rec-gpu "<command>"
```

- Host: `125.71.97.70:15302`, User: `ajifang`
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 4090 (49GB VRAM)
- Server project path: `~/projects/pony-rec-rescue-shadow-v6`

Agents can run commands directly. Do not guess server state — verify with a command.

Preferred Week8 entrypoint:

```bash
ssh pony-rec-gpu "cd ~/projects/TRUCE-Rec && git pull --ff-only && bash scripts/server/run_week8_four_domain_pipeline.sh"
```

Current Beauty controlled-adapter pilot queue:

```bash
ssh pony-rec-gpu "cd ~/projects/TRUCE-Rec && bash scripts/server/run_controlled_baseline_queue.sh smoke"
ssh pony-rec-gpu "cd ~/projects/TRUCE-Rec && bash scripts/server/run_controlled_baseline_queue.sh full"
```

Do not full-run slow OpenP5 unless docs or the user indicate scoring has been
optimized.

## Artifact Gate

Each paper-eligible run needs:

- resolved config or manifest;
- environment and git info;
- stdout/stderr logs;
- raw scores or raw LLM responses when applicable;
- `predictions.jsonl`;
- `metrics.json`;
- `metrics.csv`;
- cost/latency or runtime summary;
- official-fidelity audit for official baselines.

Every comparable method must flow through:

```text
candidate_scores.csv -> predictions.jsonl -> metrics.json + metrics.csv
```
