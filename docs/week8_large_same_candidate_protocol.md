# Week8 Large Same-Candidate Protocol

This document records the large-scale evaluation data being produced in the
parallel server project. It is the intended upgrade path after the current
Amazon Beauty early controlled-baseline pipeline.

## Source Location

Server project:

```text
~/projects/pony-rec-rescue-shadow-v6
```

Data root:

```text
~/projects/pony-rec-rescue-shadow-v6/outputs/baselines/external_tasks/
```

Same-candidate task directories:

```text
{artifact_slug}_{valid,test}_same_candidate/
```

Target domains:

| Logical domain | Artifact slug |
| --- | --- |
| `beauty` | `beauty_supplementary_smallerN_100neg` |
| `books` | `books_large10000_100neg` |
| `electronics` | `electronics_large10000_100neg` |
| `movies` | `movies_large10000_100neg` |

## Protocol

This is a reusable four-domain same-candidate evaluation package, not model
weights and not a paper result by itself.

- Up to 10,000 users for the three large domains; Beauty currently uses the
  supplementary smaller-N 100-negative artifact.
- Each event has 1 positive and 100 negatives.
- Same-candidate setting: all methods must score the same candidate items.
- Negative sampling: popularity.
- Test history mode: `train_plus_valid`.
- Seed: `20260506`.
- Shuffle seed: `42`.

Do not resample users, negatives, candidates, or histories. Do not edit
`candidate_items.csv` or `ranking_valid/test.jsonl`. Any TRUCE adapter must
read these task directories and preserve event/candidate alignment.

## Expected Files

Each task directory should contain:

- `ranking_valid.jsonl` or `ranking_test.jsonl`;
- `candidate_items.csv`;
- `train_interactions.csv`;
- `item_metadata.csv`;
- `selected_users.csv`;
- `recbole/{dataset}.inter`;
- `metadata.json`.

Check available files on the server:

```bash
find ~/projects/pony-rec-rescue-shadow-v6/outputs/baselines/external_tasks \
  -path "*large10000_100neg*" -type f | sort
```

Summary outputs from the data project should appear under:

```text
~/projects/pony-rec-rescue-shadow-v6/outputs/summary/
```

## Required Output Alignment

Models and adapters must preserve these fields whenever present:

- `source_event_id`;
- `user_id`;
- `item_id`;
- `split`.

This is required for paired comparison, oracle analysis, rank fusion, and
statistical testing across methods.

For this artifact lane, every method must export scores with this schema:

```text
source_event_id,user_id,item_id,score
```

Use the producer project's importer/evaluator:

```bash
python main_import_same_candidate_baseline_scores.py ...
```

TRUCE's internal `example_id,user_id,item_id,score` import path remains useful
for local adapters and legacy packets, but the four-domain same-candidate
artifact contract above is authoritative for cross-project evaluation.

Do not use the `test` split for hyperparameter selection. Tune only on the
declared validation split.

If reusing an LLM2Rec official result, reuse only scores/provenance/audit. Do
not make intermediate checkpoints or embeddings long-term required artifacts.

## TRUCE Migration Plan

The current Amazon Beauty controlled-baseline suite is an early pipeline and
debugging dataset. Final top-conference-strength experiments should migrate the
same framework to the Week8 large same-candidate tasks.

Migration steps:

1. Add a converter that reads a Week8 task directory and writes TRUCE-compatible
   `examples.jsonl`, `candidate_sets.jsonl`, `items.csv`, and
   `preprocess_manifest.json` without changing candidates or negatives.
2. Preserve `event_id/source_event_id` in example metadata.
3. Validate converted artifacts with
   `scripts/validate_week8_same_candidate_processed.py`.
4. Import/copy Pony/Uncertainty official-qwen3base same-candidate baseline
   evidence into TRUCE and rebuild the tracked manifest/status tables.
5. Run Ours full and ablations for beauty/books/electronics/movies.
6. Import/evaluate Ours through the TRUCE evaluator and compare against the
   reused Pony baseline manifest.
7. Run observation analysis and paired/statistical comparison across Ours and
   the reused strong baselines.

## Paper Position

Amazon Beauty can support pipeline validation and early controlled comparison.
The Week8 books/electronics/movies large same-candidate tasks should become the
main paper-scale benchmark once their metadata and summaries are finalized.

## Strict Validation

Formal Week8 conversion should use:

```bash
python scripts/convert_week8_same_candidate_to_truce.py \
  --task-dir <task_dir> \
  --output-dir <output_dir> \
  --domain <domain> \
  --split test \
  --strict-target-in-candidates
```

Then validate:

```bash
python scripts/validate_week8_same_candidate_processed.py \
  --root data/processed/week8_same_candidate \
  --domains beauty books electronics movies \
  --splits valid test \
  --expected-candidates 101 \
  --expected-negatives 100
```

Do not pass `--expected-users 10000` for the mixed four-domain validation unless
Beauty has been replaced by a 10k-user artifact. The default validator now uses
`beauty_supplementary_smallerN_100neg` for the Beauty logical domain.
