# Top-Conference Review Plan

This plan records the internal review standard before paper writing. It should
be used by future Codex agents as a reviewer checklist, not as a claim that the
paper is ready.

## Likely Rejection Reasons

1. **Novelty looks like generic LLM reranking.**
   Defense: tie every method component to the observation object: grounded
   title uncertainty, popularity residuals, long-tail under-confidence, and
   exposure-aware routing.

2. **Novelty looks stitched from senior-recommended or recent projects.**
   Defense: use those projects only for reproduction fidelity and inspiration.
   The method contribution must be an original observation-to-policy framework
   with TRUCE-specific targets, diagnostics, conservative fallback, and
   ablations. Reject paper text that merely renames another project's training
   objective, prompt format, or pipeline.

3. **Baselines are not official or are too weak.**
   Defense: reuse Pony/Uncertainty official-qwen3base same-candidate evidence
   for LLM2Rec, LLM-ESR, LLMEmb, RLMRec, IRLLRec, ELMRec, ProEx, and ProMax;
   keep legacy TRUCE controlled-adapter pilots out of final main tables.

4. **Data is too toy.**
   Defense: move from tiny/MovieLens/Beauty debugging to four-domain Week8
   same-candidate experiments with up to 10k users and 100 negatives.

5. **Candidate protocol is unfair.**
   Defense: all methods score the exact same candidate rows and preserve event
   IDs for paired testing.

6. **Uncertainty metrics are unconvincing.**
   Defense: report ECE, Brier, selective risk, wrong-high-confidence cases,
   correct-low-confidence cases, and head/mid/tail reliability.

7. **Long-tail or diversity benefit is unclear.**
   Defense: include tail Recall/NDCG/MRR, coverage, novelty, diversity, and
   popularity-stratified analysis.

8. **Ablation does not isolate the proposed framework.**
   Defense: run component ablations for grounding, uncertainty policy,
   candidate-normalized confidence, popularity residuals, echo/history guard,
   and fallback-only routing.

9. **Cost/latency is ignored.**
   Defense: record runtime, GPU memory where available, API tokens/cost where
   applicable, and throughput.

## Reviewer-Implementation Loop

For complex method work, do not let a single implementation pass define the
final design. Run an explicit loop:

```text
implementation agent proposes or edits method/code
  -> reviewer agent critiques originality, fairness, leakage, and toy risk
  -> implementation agent revises code/configs/tests
  -> main agent updates server commands and docs
```

If subagents are unavailable, perform these as separate named passes in the
main agent. The task is not done until the reviewer pass has a clear verdict,
the remaining risks are documented, and the next server command is explicit.

## Broad Literature Comparison Rule

When judging whether TRUCE-Rec is rigorous enough, do not compare only against
one or two convenient baselines. Search and read broadly across recent
SIGIR/WWW/KDD/RecSys/NeurIPS/ICLR-style recommender and LLM4Rec papers,
prioritizing official repositories or paper artifacts when available. The
comparison should ask:

- Is the method more than a prompt wrapper or generic reranker?
- Are baselines strong, official, and protocol-compatible?
- Are datasets large and multi-domain enough for the target venue?
- Are ablations sufficient to isolate each claimed contribution?
- Are statistical, efficiency, long-tail, validity, and failure analyses
  complete enough to defend the paper?

Any claim that the experiment phase is "basically done" must cite the current
artifact gates, not intuition.

## Current Method Review Note

As of 2026-05-09, a reviewer/implementation pass judged that Ours should not
stop at deterministic pairwise/listwise SFT prompts. The implemented upgrade is
`truce_observation_residual_policy_sft_v2`: an observation-to-policy target
layer with candidate-normalized utility, popularity-residual utility, harm
risk, abstain risk, and conservative `promote/suppress/defer_to_fallback`
actions. This improves technical depth relative to a prompt-only reranker, but
it is still only a training objective scaffold until server runs and ablations
prove utility.

Reviewer risk that remains: the policy targets are deterministic scaffolds. A
stronger final method should incorporate real observation diagnostics and
validation-fitted calibration/residualization before claiming learned
uncertainty behavior.

## Writing-Ready Gate

The experiment phase can move to paper writing only when a reviewer-style pass
finds no fatal gap in:

- four-domain same-candidate coverage;
- base Qwen3-8B and four senior-recommended baseline observation analyses;
- official/fair baseline training, scoring, import, and evaluation;
- Ours full and ablation artifacts;
- paired significance and slice metrics;
- efficiency/cost/runtime logs;
- case studies and limitations;
- reproducibility manifests, configs, git/environment records, and raw score
  or raw response preservation.

If the gate is satisfied, tell the user the project has entered the
writing-ready stage. If not, list only the concrete blockers and the shortest
plan to close them.

## Required Reviewer Tables

- Main four-domain ranking table.
- Official-native controlled baseline table.
- Ours ablation table.
- Observation/reliability table.
- Long-tail/popularity-stratified table.
- Validity/hallucination/candidate-adherence table.
- Efficiency/cost table.
- Statistical significance table or appendix.

## Required Case Studies

- wrong-high-confidence generated title;
- correct-low-confidence tail item;
- hallucinated title that cannot be grounded;
- popularity-biased high-confidence recommendation;
- Ours reroutes away from risky generated item;
- Ours failure where uncertainty policy hurts.

## Internal Reviewer Agent Prompt

Use this prompt after each full experiment phase:

```text
Act as a SIGIR/WWW/RecSys/NeurIPS reviewer. Given the current metrics,
artifacts, configs, and docs, identify fatal flaws in originality, baseline
fairness, data scale, leakage, ablations, statistical testing, efficiency,
long-tail analysis, and reproducibility. Do not praise the work unless the
artifact evidence supports it. List missing experiments before paper claims.
Also check whether the proposed method is a genuinely original TRUCE/CURE
framework or only a stitched combination of senior-recommended papers.
```

## Literature Agent Prompt

Use this prompt before freezing baselines:

```text
Act as an LLM4Rec literature auditor. Check whether each selected baseline is
representative, official-native where claimed, and comparable under the shared
Qwen3-8B base-model and TRUCE candidate/evaluator protocol. Flag missing
recent baselines and classify them as main, appendix, long-tail, sequential, or
efficiency baselines.
```
