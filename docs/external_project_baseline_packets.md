# External Project Baseline Packets

This document tracks official external LLM4Rec project integrations. It is a
packet and execution-status matrix, not a paper result table.

For the main fair-comparison lane that controls the small LLM backbone and LoRA
budget, see `docs/qwen3_lora_controlled_baselines.md`. The first main-table
suite is TALLRec, OpenP5-style, DEALRec, and LC-Rec with Qwen3-8B LoRA.

## Packet Generation

OpenP5 should be run first. Generate its packets with:

```powershell
py -3 scripts/prepare_project_baseline_packet.py --config configs/server/project_baselines/openp5_movielens_packet.yaml
py -3 scripts/prepare_project_baseline_packet.py --config configs/server/project_baselines/openp5_amazon_beauty_packet.yaml
```

Generate all packet contracts when preparing the server queue:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem configs/server/project_baselines/*_packet.yaml |
  ForEach-Object { py -3 scripts/prepare_project_baseline_packet.py --config $_.FullName }
```

Each packet contains canonical TRUCE artifacts plus project-facing files:

- `truce_examples.jsonl`
- `truce_candidate_sets.jsonl`
- `item_catalog.jsonl`
- `<project>/*_project_tasks.jsonl` for generic projects
- `openp5/*_sequential_tasks.jsonl` for OpenP5
- `tallrec/*.json` and row maps for TALLRec
- `candidate_scores_template.csv`
- `project_baseline_manifest.json`

External projects must return:

```text
example_id,user_id,item_id,score
```

Then import and evaluate with:

```powershell
py -3 scripts/import_external_predictions.py `
  --scores <candidate_scores.csv> `
  --examples <packet>/truce_examples.jsonl `
  --output <run_dir>/predictions.jsonl `
  --method <method> `
  --source-project <project> `
  --model-name <model> `
  --seed 13 `
  --split test

py -3 scripts/evaluate_predictions.py --predictions <run_dir>/predictions.jsonl --output-dir <run_dir>
```

## OpenP5 Priority

OpenP5 is the first external project to execute because it is a recognized P5
family baseline and already has a project-specific sequential-task packet. The
server adapter smoke has already adapted `openp5/*_sequential_tasks.jsonl` into
a T5-style bridge template and proved that a candidate score CSV can be imported
and evaluated by TRUCE.

OpenP5 outputs may be item tokens, generated item strings, or scores. Any
generated output must be grounded back to canonical TRUCE `item_id`; invalid or
ungrounded outputs are not paper-successes and must remain auditable.

The next OpenP5 server task is to replace the deterministic smoke scores with a
real OpenP5/T5 scorer or official training/evaluation run, then import with
`--split test`.

For the main controlled comparison, prefer `OpenP5-style-Qwen3-LoRA` over an
uncontrolled OpenP5 T5 checkpoint unless both are clearly separated in tables.

## Generic Project Contract

BIGRec, DEALRec, LC-Rec, LLaRA, CoLLM, LLM-ESR, and SLMRec currently share the
generic packet contract:

- train/valid/test task JSONL with history, target, candidates, and item text;
- item mapping CSV;
- test candidate map;
- candidate score template.

This is enough to start real upstream integration without changing TRUCE splits,
negative sampling, or evaluator definitions. A project becomes an official
baseline only after its upstream code is cloned, environment is recorded, a real
run is completed, and its scores are imported/evaluated by TRUCE.

## Diagnostic Rows

The Amazon Beauty TALLRec-style Qwen3 zero-shot scorer is recorded only in
`outputs/tables/paper_project_baseline_diagnostics.*`. It is not an official
trained TALLRec result and must not appear in the main strong-baseline table.

The OpenP5 Amazon Beauty adapter smoke is an even weaker diagnostic: it is only
a bridge/import/evaluator smoke test and should stay out of both main and
appendix result tables unless a future diagnostic table explicitly lists
plumbing checks.
